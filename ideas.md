# Ideas
- A starting room that players are not allowed to leave until the mode starts.
- A ready-up system to avoid one player accidentally starting the mode without everyone.
- A countdown before the mode starts so it's less sudden.
- Do I have a function that breaks all of the fences before the game starts?
- Reducing the number of players on team 1 should increase the number of dummy bots.
- Players who join in progress spawn phased out and invisible. They spawn in the store with a message informing them about their situation, once they exit the store they are returned to normal.

### Target Priorities
- Interesting, but can be ignored. Quite costly to buy but free to swap.
- Often a no-brainer to pick.
- Low priority implementation, possible I might drop this feature; ai should be responsive/reactive enough to not need it.
### Upgrades
- Reduce the strength of each tier but add more tiers.
- Can buy normal health, shield health, and armour health.
- Can buy increased damage and increased healing.
#### Health
- Base health, cheapest.
#### Shield
- Shield health, slightly more expensive.
#### Armour
- Armour health, very expensive.
#### Damage
- Increases damage dealth as a percentage.
#### Healing
- Increases healing dealt as a percentage.
#### Haste
Look into ways to get it working with:
- Abilities with charges
- Ashe's coach gun
- Bastion's turret form
- Genji's swift strike
- Soldier: 76's helix rockets.
#### Ult Generation
- Percentage increase.
#### Movement Speed
- Would have to be very minor and very expensive.
- Percentage increase or fixed amount?
#### Knockback received reduction
- Very nice QOL upgrade.
#### Knockback dealt increase
- Useless on most heroes.
- Potential to be busted if used on a map with insta-kill hazards.
#### Ammo
- If bulletstorm isn't used.
- Wouldn't work for heroes with no ammo.
- Still have to worry about ammo setting being broken on new heroes.
### Abilities
- The per round random is an interesting idea and makes each playthrough unqiue however it can lead to minor frustration when you never get the abilities you want.
- It leads to a kind of boring meta where you should never spend any money on normal upgrades and sometimes talents and instead spend it all on abilities until you have what you need.
#### Bulletstorm
- If Blizz still haven't fixed new heroes in workshop, maybe shelve this.
- Also causes issues with peacekeeper alt fire.
- I wonder if there is a way to increase reload speed.
#### Shockproof
- Remove speed bonus, passthrough, and armour.
### Active Abilities
- Have a cooldown.
- Activated by holding melee. Could be moved to interact.
- Expensive to purchase into but free to swap.
- Often ignored.
- Unless I can think of something interesting I'm going to drop this to save elements.
### Talents
- No talents with quick melee to avoid any conflicts with active abilities. Unless it is moved to interact.
- Current scope is 2 talents per hero.
- Hack should disable talents.
#### Ana
#### Ashe
##### White phosphourous
- Dynamite burn lasts twice as long and killing burning enemies sets nearby enemies on fire.
##### Black powder
- Coach gun stuns all enemies hit for 1.5 seconds.
#### Baptiste
- Corrode is good, great for AOE damage.
- Glide is stupid.
#### Bastion
- Rockets while shooting in turret is cool and helps with AOE damage.
- Current grenade talent is fun but ineffective against high hp enemies. Leans towards useless when enemy health is scaled with extra players.
#### Brigitte
- Explosive whipshot could be cool.
#### Cassidy
- Magnetic grenade talent no longer valid.
- Deadeye locking enemies in place is cool but buggy.
- Maybe some talent that rewards accuracy. Headshots return the round to the chamber?
#### D.va
- Something with her micro-missiles.
- D.va is the kind of hero that would be really bad for low skill players and busted for high skill players. Need a talent that attempts to flatten the difference.
#### Doomfist
- Has the potential to be a really fun brawling hero.
- If enemies have stuns he could be stunted and would need a talent to offset it.
- Empowering rocket punch is a simple talent idea.
#### Echo
- Bomber jacket is a cool talent but could potentially overlap with an idea I had for Pharah, either way the name kinda blows.
- Focusing optics is strong but quite boring and unengaging.
- Ability cooldown reduction may lead to Echo being permanently in the skybox leading to boring spectator gameplay.
#### Genji
- Will likely be very fun to play.
- Would struggle against high hp enemies.
- If active abilities are removed, a melee talent that deals percentage based backstab damage would be interesting.
- Temporary damage boost on elimation to encourage chain kills.
- Reduces swift strike cooldown for every enemy hit by it.
#### Hanzo
- Desperately needs AOE damage.
- Hanzo might be able to cheese some bosses by abusing wallclimb.
- Could potentially just steal from Marvel Rivals the idea about increased damage when staring at an enemy while drawn.
- Is it possible to increase damage received on enemies inside Sonic Arrow AOE?
##### Wrath of the Dragon
- Holding primary fire passed max draw time continues to increase damage dealt, displayed with a meter.
- Might need to reset on wallclimb.
#### Hazard
- Enemies would likely not be able see and react to wall.
- Block would be insanely strong. Doesn't need a talent.
- Lunge reset on kill?
#### Illari
- Enemies will never shoot pylon.
- Her ult is really strong.
- Enemies near pylon take increased damage.
##### Solar flare
- Outburst deals more damage and sets enemies on fire.
#### Junker Queen
- Passive healing is likely to be fucking busted.
#### Junkrat
- Very strong in pve.
- Burn on damage is really good for not needing to follow up on low health enemies.
- Extra mines, while fun, make him too mobile and lead to annoyance with teammates with the constant knockbacks.
- Could use the talent where he drops bombs while mine jumping.
#### Juno
- Very strong in PvE.
#### Kiriko
- Need something to encourage healing.
#### Lifeweaver
- Current talents are very boring.
#### Lucio
- Reverse song effect on crossfade is a simple talent idea.
- Extra projectiles while amping is very fun.
#### Mauga
- Naturally strong in pve.
#### Mei
- Enemies would likely not be able see and react to wall.
- Could do instant freeze on exiting cryo.
#### Mercy
- Would be quite boring to play, yet still gravitate players.
- Res is less useful when everyone can do it. Would need to be instant.
- Could do mass rez? Might be too strong.
#### Moira
- Needs talents that encourage a hybrid playstyle.
- Gameplay would likely devolve to farming ult.
#### Orisa
##### Shrapnel
- Javelin Spin fires many pellets that deal damage and knockback.
##### Tailwind
- Increases Javelin Throw projectile speed and deals knockback and damage around impact point.
#### Pharah
##### Rocket Queen
- Using Jump Jet or Jet Dash fires a small group of homing rockets.
#### Ramattra
- Vortex giving ult charge is nice but a bit unengaging.
#### Reaper
- Lifesteal makes reaper incredibly strong.
#### Reinhardt
- Don't want rein to be a shield bot. But also don't want to run the risk of him being unkillable.
- Lava firestrike is cool.
#### Roadhog
- Feels incredibly good to be a one man apocalyse.
- Hook reset on kill makes hog a squishy destroying monster.
- Ult deletes bosses.
#### Sigma
- Ult is very good.
- Vortex is also very good.
#### Sojourn
- Remove explosive headshots. Maybe make all railgun shots deal explosive damage? Scaled by the charge of the shot.
#### Soldier: 76
- With very little shields soldier is going to output a lot of damage, ult will also be strong.
- Something with heal station would be cool, maybe make it res teammates.
#### Sombra
- Using translocator to deal a burst of damage and hack enemies is interesting and fun but doesn't mesh well with the new rework.
- Doing something with virus would be really cool. Possible to make it spread?
#### Symmetra
- Is it possible for enemies to target her teleporter? If not, high level teams could abuse it.
#### Torbjorn
- Is it possible for enemies to target his turret?
- Overload is quite strong.
- A talent to make the hammer strong would be fun but I don't want it to be so strong that it overshadows his gun.
#### Tracer
- Chain sticky bomb damage is cool.
#### Venture
- Burrow is strong.
- Ult is very strong.
##### Plow
- Drill dash hits in a larger area and knocks enemies down.
#### Widowmaker
- One ability should improve her effectiveness against boss enemies while the other should improve her effectiveness against crowds.
- Would be cool if I could do something with venom mine. Maybe make it spread?
- Explosive headshots are an easy talent idea, good fallback if I cannot think of anything else.
#### Winston
- Is very strong at dealing with crowds of squishies.
- Useless against bosses.
- Could do something interesting with his ranged attack.
- Kills reset jump pack.
#### Wrecking Ball
- Will be extremely strong if enemies have no stuns or hinders.
- Incendiary rounds would not increases his strength much but be fun to use. Risks overlapping with Mauga.
#### Zarya
- Effectiveness depends on whether the ai is smart enough to not shoot bubble.
- Very likely to end up a boring dps hero.
#### Zenyatta
- Discord makes Zen very strong against bosses.
- Would need to make his moment to moment gameplay very satisfying to encourage players to pick him.
## Enemies
### Spawning
- Enemy spawn quota: The game expects an amount of each type of enemy to spawn and will select a random enemy type to fill that quota.
- Quota scales with difficulty.
- Enemy respawn times scale with difficulty.
- Chances of spawning each enemy type is based on the enemy "challenge" rating, the current round, and the number of players.
- Should I also include a minor skill rating?
### Ai
**Don't bother trying to come up with custom names for the enemies until the end.**
- Every enemy has an aggressiveness number calculated based on their current situtation such as current health (factoring in armour), abilities (including ultimate).
- They also have a confidence number.
- The ai uses this to determine if it should perform certain actions: ```if (aggressiveness - (1-confidence) > action_weight)```
- Certain ai types should try to cut enemies off (flankers).
- Could mark certain nodes as "key nodes" used for important movements such as rotations and flanking.
- Lower tier enemies will try to hang near higher tier enemies to support them.
- Looking at an enemy who is targeting you has a chance to make them start strafing, increasing with range.
- Abilities can be marked as offensive, defensive, evasive, supportive to be applicable to a generic weighted system.
- Has a patrol mode that faces in random directions ever couple of seconds.
- Targets are acquired by LOS, filtered by FOV; could use a narrow far and wide short FOV.
- Movement will be the most complicated system, shouldn't just beeline to team 1.
### Pathing
- Used by the ai but should be considered distinct.
- [Made with Deltin's pathmap editor](https://github.com/ItsDeltin/Pathmap-editor)
- [Made a fork to reduce the element count.](https://github.com/SlenderFox/Pathmap-editor-gutted).

### Bosses
- Ability where if a boss is low on health it kills all the minions around itself and absorbs their health, healing the boss.
### Heroes
- Tiers can either be more challenging variants of the same hero, or a way to group heroes by difficulty.
- Could potentially do both?
#### Need to be sorted into a tier
##### Ana
- Has potential to be an interesting enemy.
- Long/medium range.
- High potency, would need to be higher tier.

- Interesting enemy that gets more engaging the better implemented he is.
##### Hanzo
- Medium range spam threat.
- Would need to remove headshot insta-kill to be fun to fight.
##### Hazard
- Could be a cool enemy.
- Highly aggresive.
- Similar issue with mei, could just simply fire right behind enemy.
- Block will be hard to implement.

- Would be pretty boring
- Pylon would be difficult to implement intelligently but would be an easy source of healing for the enemy.
- Ult would be a geniune threat.

- Abilities would be simple to implement.
- Runs the risk of being boring to fight or impossible to kill.
##### Junkrat
- Ult would be a great spike threat.
- Could be a medium range spam threat.
##### Juno
- Very difficult to implement.
##### Kiriko
- Everything in her kit is difficult to implement.
- Ult has potential to be interesting.
##### Lifeweaver
- Tree could be cool.
- Every other ability would not work/be difficult to implement.
##### Lucio
- Yes.
- Wallride is likely impossible to implement.
##### Mauga
- Left click at range, both when close.
- Very aggressive, tries to get in close.
- Great boss type enemy.
##### Mei
- All abilities except wall would be very simple.
- Could have premade points where mei wants to wall.
- Would be more likely to hurt her own team more than help it.

- Resource meter is possibly unseen to the workshop.
##### Orisa
- Would be very unfun to fight.
- Only used as a boss enemy.
##### Pharah
- Full flight movement could be hard, easier to be a ground unit.
- Movement would likely be controlled with pathing attributes.
##### Ramattra
- Thematic and potentially engaging enemy.
- Shield might be hard to implement.
##### Reaper
- Spook is an interesting concept.
- Wasn't too engaging to fight however.
##### Reinhardt
- Holds shield at range, occasionally firestriking when confident.
- Boss type enemy.
##### Roadhog
- Potential to be unengaging damage sponge.
- Similar vein to Junker Queen.
##### Sigma
- Very hard to implement well.
- Ult is a great interaction.
##### Sojourn
- Unlikely to have workshop functionality to gauge charge level.
- Would be a boring low tier enemy.
##### Soldier: 76

- Can be a big angry disrupter threat in ult.
##### Wrecking ball
- Swinging is basically impossible to implement.
- Ground slam follows in suit.
- Probably can be reserved entirely for the portal.
- Detonator, slowly rolls towards players. Uses ult when close then immediately dies dealing damage to enemies around him.
- Could be good for bunker busting.
##### Zarya
- Is projected barrier possible?
- Could support a boss enemy or be a boss enemy herself.
- Bubble could be interesting or annoying, maybe a long cooldown?
##### Zenyatta
- Are his abilities possible to implement?
- Could be a great enemy type.
- Long range, medium tier.
### Mutators
- I think this is an interesing idea.
- Increases complexity over time and can be used to scale complexity on higher difficulties (if I implement that).
- Has a potentially large element cost, should try to keep this a low as I can.
- Lower priority to implement.
## Maps
- For now I would like to do Kanezaka; I am tired of Chateau Guillard.
- It is unlikely I would be able to fit many maps into one gamemode and might be limited to only one.
- Eventually I would like to do all dedicated deathmatch maps, converted deathmatch maps, and maybe the elimination maps and Ayutthaya.
