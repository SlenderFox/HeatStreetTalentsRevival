# Ideas
- A starting room that players are not allowed to leave until the mode starts.
- A ready-up system to avoid one player accidentally starting the mode without everyone.
- A countdown before the mode starts so it's less sudden.
- Do I have a function that breaks all of the fences before the game starts?
- For development, maybe have a very basic pathmap on the workshop island.
## Shop
### Target Priorities
- Interesting, but can be ignored. Quite costly to buy but free to swap.
- Often a no-brainer to pick.
### Upgrades
- Reduce the strength of each tier but add more tiers.
- Can buy normal health, shield health, and armour health.
- Can buy increased damage and increased healing.
#### Health
- Base health, cheapest.
#### Shield
- Shield health, slightly more expensive.
#### Armour
- Armour health, very expensive.
#### Damage
- Increases damage dealth as a percentage.
#### Healing
- Increases healing dealt as a percentage.
#### Haste
Look into ways to get it working with:
- Abilities with charges
- Ashe's coach gun
- Bastion's turret form
- Genji's swift strike
- Soldier: 76's helix rockets.
#### Ult Generation
- Percentage increase.
#### Movement Speed
- Would have to be very minor and very expensive.
- Percentage increase or fixed amount?
#### Knockback received reduction
- Very nice QOL upgrade.
#### Knockback dealt increase
- Useless on most heroes.
- Potential to be busted if used on a map with insta-kill hazards.
#### Ammo
- If bulletstorm isn't used.
- Wouldn't work for heroes with no ammo.
- Still have to worry about ammo setting being broken on new heroes.
### Abilities
- The per round random is an interesting idea and makes each playthrough unqiue however it can lead to minor frustration when you never get the abilities you want.
- It leads to a kind of boring meta where you should never spend any money on normal upgrades and sometimes talents and instead spend it all on abilities until you have what you need.
#### Bulletstorm
- If Blizz still haven't fixed new heroes in workshop, maybe shelve this.
- Also causes issues with peacekeeper alt fire.
- I wonder if there is a way to increase reload speed.
#### Shockproof
- Remove speed bonus, passthrough, and armour.
### Active Abilities
- Have a cooldown.
- Activated with melee.
- Expensive to purchase into but free to swap.
- Often ignored.
### Talents
- No talents with quick melee to avoid any conflicts with active abilities.
- Current scope is 2 talents per hero.
- Hack should disable talents.
#### Ana
#### Ashe
##### White phosphourous
- Dynamite burn lasts twice as long and killing burning enemies sets nearby enemies on fire.
##### Black powder
- Coach gun stuns all enemies hit for 1.5 seconds.
#### Baptiste
- Corrode is good, great for AOE damage.
- Glide is stupid.
#### Bastion
- Rockets while shooting in turret is cool and helps with AOE damage.
- Current grenade talent is fun but ineffective against high hp enemies. Leans towards useless when enemy health is scaled with extra players.
#### Brigitte
- Explosive whipshot could be cool.
#### Cassidy
- Magnetic grenade talent no longer valid.
- Deadeye locking enemies in place is cool but buggy.
#### D.va
- Something with her micro-missiles.
- D.va is the kind of hero that would be really bad for low skill players and busted for high skill players. Need a talent that attempts to flatten the difference.
#### Doomfist
- Has the potential to be a really fun brawling hero.
- If enemies have stuns he could be stunted and would need a talent to offset it.
- Empowering rocket punch is a simple talent idea.
#### Echo
- Bomber jacket is a cool talent but could potentially overlap with an idea I had for Pharah, either way the name kinda blows.
- Focusing optics is strong but quite boring and unengaging.
- Ability cooldown reduction may lead to Echo being permanently in the skybox leading to boring spectator gameplay.
#### Genji
- Will likely be very fun to play.
- Would struggle against high hp enemies.
- If active abilities are removed, a melee talent that deals percentage based backstab damage would be interesting.
#### Hanzo
- Desperately needs AOE damage.
- Hanzo might be able to cheese some bosses by abusing wallclimb.
- Could potentially just steal from Marvel Rivals the idea about increased damage when staring at an enemy while drawn.
- Is it possible to increase damage received on enemies inside Sonic Arrow AOE?
##### Wrath of the Dragon
- Holding primary fire passed max draw time continues to increase damage dealt, displayed with a meter.
- Might need to reset on wallclimb.
#### Hazard
- Enemies would likely not be able see and react to wall.
- Block would be insanely strong. Doesn't need a talent.
- Lunge reset on kill?
#### Illari
- Enemies will never shoot pylon.
- Her ult is really strong.
- Enemies near pylon take increased damage.
##### Solar flare
- Outburst deals more damage and sets enemies on fire.
#### Junker Queen
- Passive healing is likely to be fucking busted.
#### Junkrat
- Very strong in pve.
- Burn on damage is really good for not needing to follow up on low health enemies.
- Extra mines, while fun, make him too mobile and lead to annoyance with teammates with the constant knockbacks.
- Could use the talent where he drops bombs while mine jumping.
#### Juno
- Very strong in PvE.
#### Kiriko
- Need something to encourage healing.
#### Lifeweaver
- Current talents are very boring.
#### Lucio
- Reverse song effect on crossfade is a simple talent idea.
- Extra projectiles while amping is very fun.
#### Mauga
- Naturally strong in pve.
#### Mei
- Enemies would likely not be able see and react to wall.
- Could do instant freeze on exiting cryo.
#### Mercy
- Would be quite boring to play, yet still gravitate players.
- Res is less useful when everyone can do it. Would need to be instant.
- Could do mass rez? Might be too strong.
#### Moira
- Needs talents that encourage a hybrid playstyle.
- Gameplay would likely devolve to farming ult.
#### Orisa
##### Shrapnel
- Javelin Spin fires many pellets that deal damage and knockback.
##### Tailwind
- Increases Javelin Throw projectile speed and deals knockback and damage around impact point.
#### Pharah
##### Rocket Queen
- Using Jump Jet or Jet Dash fires a small group of homing rockets.
#### Ramattra
- Vortex giving ult charge is nice but a bit unengaging.
#### Reaper
- Lifesteal makes reaper incredibly strong.
#### Reinhardt
- Don't want rein to be a shield bot. But also don't want to run the risk of him being unkillable.
- Lava firestrike is cool.
#### Roadhog
- Feels incredibly good to be a one man apocalyse.
- Hook reset on kill makes hog a squishy destroying monster.
- Ult deletes bosses.
#### Sigma
- Ult is very good.
- Vortex is also very good.
#### Sojourn
- Remove explosive headshots. Maybe make all railgun shots deal explosive damage? Scaled by the charge of the shot.
#### Soldier: 76
- With very little shields soldier is going to output a lot of damage, ult will also be strong.
- Something with heal station would be cool, maybe make it res teammates.
#### Sombra
- Using translocator to deal a burst of damage and hack enemies is interesting and fun but doesn't mesh well with the new rework.
- Doing something with virus would be really cool. Possible to make it spread?
#### Symmetra
- Is it possible for enemies to target her teleporter? If not, high level teams could abuse it.
#### Torbjorn
- Is it possible for enemies to target his turret?
- Overload is quite strong.
- A talent to make the hammer strong would be fun but I don't want it to be so strong that it overshadows his gun.
#### Tracer
- Chain sticky bomb damage is cool.
#### Venture
- Burrow is strong.
- Ult is very strong.
##### Plow
- Drill dash hits in a larger area and knocks enemies down.
#### Widowmaker
- One ability should improve her effectiveness against boss enemies while the other should improve her effectiveness against crowds.
- Would be cool if I could do something with venom mine. Maybe make it spread?
- Explosive headshots are an easy talent idea, good fallback if I cannot think of anything else.
#### Winston
- Is very strong at dealing with crowds of squishies.
- Useless against bosses.
- Could do something interesting with his ranged attack.
#### Wrecking Ball
- Will be extremely strong if enemies have no stuns or hinders.
- Incendiary rounds would not increases his strength much but be fun to use. Risks overlapping with Mauga.
#### Zarya
- Effectiveness depends on whether the ai is smart enough to not shoot bubble.
- Very likely to end up a boring dps hero.
#### Zenyatta
- Discord makes Zen very strong against bosses.
- Would need to make his moment to moment gameplay very satisfying to encourage players to pick him.
## Enemies
### Spawning
- Enemy spawn quota: The game expects an amount of each type of enemy to spawn and will select a random enemy type to fill that quota.
- Quota scales with difficulty.
- Enemy respawn times scale with difficulty.
- Chances of spawning each enemy type is based on the enemy "challenge" rating, the current round, and the number of players.
- Should I also include a minor skill rating?
### Ai
- Every enemy has an aggressiveness number calculated based on their current situtation such as current health (factoring in armour), abilities (including ultimate).
- They also have a confidence number.
- The ai uses this to determine if it should perform certain actions: ```if (aggressiveness - (1-confidence) > action_weight)```
- Certain ai types should try to cut enemies off.
- Some ai types will try to remain close to strong enemies (on their own team).
- Don't bother trying to come up with custom names for the enemies until the end.
### Pathing
- Used within the ai but should be considered distinct.
- [Made with Deltin's pathmap editor](https://github.com/ItsDeltin/Pathmap-editor)
- May need to fork to reduce the element count. [fork](https://github.com/SlenderFox/Pathmap-editor-gutted).

## Maps
- For now I would like to do Kanezaka; I am tired of Chateau Guillard.
- It is unlikely I would be able to fit many maps into one gamemode and might be limited to only one.
- Eventually I would like to do all dedicated deathmatch maps, converted deathmatch maps, and maybe the elimination maps and Ayutthaya.
